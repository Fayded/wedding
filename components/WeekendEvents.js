          <p>Mid-Century Hotel - An IHG Property. Welcome to Kimpton Sylvan Hotel, an unexpected oasis tucked away in Atlanta&lsquo;s Buckhead area, aka &lsquo;The Beverly Hills of the South.&rsquo; We&lsquo;ve transformed a sprawling 1950s residential building into a boutique enclave. Mid-century style and modern-chic design cavort effortlessly throughout the space, from the supper club-style restaurant to the cheeky rooftop bar (voted one of Esquire&lsquo;s Best Bars in America in 2022). Outside, nearly 5,000 square feet of gardens lure you with hidden nooks, plus a sparkling pool. Here, just steps from high-style shopping, dining, galleries and nightlife, Georgia hospitality is warm and estive all at once.</p>
